### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can find me on telegram https://t.me/LordLeprikon

## My Projects
 1. My site: https://24sudak24.ru/. I became interested in web development, so I decided to write a website for my friends.
 
 2. Escrow project. Together with my team, I have developed an escrow service based on smart contracts that do not need an intermediary compared to centralized competitors. This allows you to make secure peer-to-peer purchases with a minimum commission and a maximum level of trust. Funds are frozen in the escrow account until the buyer confirms that the goods or service have been received. In this project, I was responsible for frontend development. You can see the presentation of our project on devpost: https://devpost.com/software/web3-escrow-service. Now we have closed public access to the repository, but you can look at the application at the link: http://92.255.77.197:3084
 
 3. Flood forecasting service. I made a python program with which, according to satellite images, it is possible to prevent floods and save many buildings from flooding. Link to the project: https://github.com/NikitaKorablev/Analysis-of-satellite-images

 4. My team and I are winners of the hackathon "Digital Breakthrough: Artificial Intelligence Season". We took the second place in the case from the Russian Railways company (Ð Ð–Ð”) - "Coordination of the passage of car traffic". Here you can see the solution we wrote: https://github.com/Atikin-NT/hacks-ai
